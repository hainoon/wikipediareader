# wikipediareader

The Spoken Wikipedia project unites volunteer readers of encyclopedic entries. Their recordings make encyclopedic knowledge accessible to persons who are unable to read (out of alexia, visual impairment, or because their sight is currently occupied, e. g. while driving). However, on Wikipedia, recordings are available as raw audio files that can only be consumed linearly, without the possibility for targeted navigation or search. We present a reading application which uses an alignment between the recording, text and article structure and which allows to navigate spoken articles, through a graphical or voice-based user interface (or a combination thereof).

Roughly a thousand articles for each of English, German and Dutch are available, each totalling around 300 hours of speech (with smaller amounts in another 25 languages). This data has recently been made accessible by [KÃ¶hn et al.][koehnetal] who automatically aligned the audio recordings to their respective article texts using speech recognition technology. Using these alignments, we are able to relate what parts of the article are spoken at any moment in the recordings.
